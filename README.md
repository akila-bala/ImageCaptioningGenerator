# Image Caption Generator

An Image Caption Generator is a deep learning model designed to generate textual descriptions of an image. It works by first encoding the image into a feature representation and then using that representation to generate a sequence of words that describes the content of the image. The model is typically trained on large datasets of images and their corresponding captions, and can then be used to generate captions for new images. Image caption generators have a variety of applications, including improving accessibility for visually impaired individuals, generating alt-text for images in a web page, and enhancing the ability of search engines to understand the content of an image.
